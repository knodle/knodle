    This function allows to perform the splitting of data instances into k folds according to the rules matched
    in them. The splitting could be performed in several iterations (defined by "partition" parameter).
    The logic is the following:
        for each partition:
        - the rules are shuffled
        - the rules are splitted into k folds
        - each fold iteratively becomes a hold-out fold
        - the samples that matched the rules from the hold-out fold are added to the hold-out test set
        - other samples are added to the train set
    The train and test sets do not intersect. If a sample matched several rules and one of the rules is included
    in the test set (and therefore the sample as well), this sample won't be included in the training set.
    Correspondingly, such samples (where multiple rules matched) are included into several hold-out folds depending on
    which of the relevant rules is selected to the hold-out fold in the current splitting.
