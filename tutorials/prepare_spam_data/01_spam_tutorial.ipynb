    "In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of using Snorkel to build a training set for classifying YouTube comments as spam or not spam.\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to illustrate the basic components and concepts of Snorkel in a simple way, but also to dive into the actual process of iteratively developing real applications in Snorkel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that this is a toy dataset that helps highlight the different features of Snorkel. For examples of high-performance, real-world uses of Snorkel, see [our publications list](https://www.snorkel.org/resources/).**\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally:\n",
    "* For an overview of Snorkel, visit [snorkel.org](https://snorkel.org)\n",
    "* You can also check out the [Snorkel API documentation](https://snorkel.readthedocs.io/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to train a classifier over the comment data that can predict whether a comment is spam or not spam.\n",
    "We have access to a large amount of *unlabeled data* in the form of YouTube comments with some metadata.\n",
    "In order to train a classifier, we need to label our data, but doing so by hand for real world applications can often be prohibitively slow and expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these cases, we can turn to a _weak supervision_ approach, using **_labeling functions (LFs)_** in Snorkel: noisy, programmatic rules and heuristics that assign labels to unlabeled training data.\n",
    "We'll dive into the Snorkel API and how we write labeling functions later in this tutorial, but as an example,\n",
    "we can write an LF that labels data points with `\"http\"` in the comment text as spam since many spam\n",
    "comments contain links:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from snorkel.labeling import labeling_function\n",
    "\n",
    "@labeling_function()\n",
    "def lf_contains_link(x):\n",
    "    # Return a label of SPAM if \"http\" in comment text, otherwise ABSTAIN\n",
    "    return SPAM if \"http\" in x.text.lower() else ABSTAIN\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is divided into four parts:\n",
    "1. **Loading Data**: We load a [YouTube comments dataset](http://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago//youtubespamcollection/), originally introduced in [\"TubeSpam: Comment Spam Filtering on YouTube\"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7424299/), ICMLA'15 (T.C. Alberto, J.V. Lochter, J.V. Almeida).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Writing Labeling Functions**: We write Python programs that take as input a data point and assign labels (or abstain) using heuristics, pattern matching, and third-party models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combining Labeling Function Outputs with the Label Model**: We model the outputs of the labeling functions over the training set using a novel, theoretically-grounded [modeling approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07723), which estimates the accuracies and correlations of the labeling functions using only their agreements and disagreements, and then uses this to reweight and combine their outputs, which we then use as _probabilistic_ training labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Training a Classifier**: We train a classifier that can predict labels for *any* YouTube comment (not just the ones labeled by the labeling functions) using the probabilistic training labels from step 3."

    "### Data Splits in Snorkel\n",
    "\n",
    "We split our data into two sets:\n",
    "* **Training Set**: The largest split of the dataset, and the one without any ground truth (\"gold\") labels.\n",
    "We will generate labels for these data points with weak supervision.\n",
    "* **Test Set**: A small, standard held-out blind hand-labeled set for final evaluation of our classifier. This set should only be used for final evaluation, _not_ error analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in more advanced production settings, we will often further split up the available hand-labeled data into a _development split_, for getting ideas to write labeling functions, and a _validation split_ for e.g. checking our performance without looking at test set scores, hyperparameter tuning, etc.  These splits are used in some of the other advanced tutorials, but omitted for simplicity here."
