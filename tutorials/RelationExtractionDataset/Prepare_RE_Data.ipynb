    "In this small tutorial we are going to look at how we could make the weak annotation of data for relation extraction task using simple patterns. \n",

    "For that, we are going to use CONLL dataset that already has gold labels, which we are going to use for comparing with the labels we receive. \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps are the follwoing:\n",
    "- process the data in CONLL format (an example is stored in the same folder, \"dev.conll\" file)\n",
    "- extract all the relevant for us information (the sample and the relation label)\n",
    "- create a samll set of hand-crafted patterns in the format: \"$ARG1 <some words> $ARG2\" where $ARG1 and $ARG2 are the entities between that the relation is hold\n",
    "- annotated sample with Spacy package in order to get the entities\n",
    "- take the entities pairwise and extract the part of sentences between them \n",
    "\n",
    "(e.g. from a sentence \"Margaret Thatcher was born on 13 October 1925\" a subsentence \"$ARG1 was born on $ARG2\" will be extracted given \"Margaret Thatcher\" and \"13 October 1925\" were the only entities defined by Spacy)\n",
    "\n",
    "- check if there is a pattern in this subsentences. If so, it receives a label corresponding to the relation that pattern support and becomes a part of our new weakly annotated training set. "
