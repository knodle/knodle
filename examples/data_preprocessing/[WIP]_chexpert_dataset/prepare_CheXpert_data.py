"""
This file shows how to download and preprocess the CheXpert dataset for making weakly supervised experiments.

The original CheXpert paper, "CheXpert: A Large Chest Radiograph Dataset with Uncertainty Labels and Expert Comparison" by Irvin et al. (2019), can be found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.07031.pdf.

The CheXpert training set is composed of chest radiographs, which were annotated on the basis of reports using the rule-based CheXpert labeler. 
Each image is labeled with respect to 12 pathologies as well as the observations "No Finding" and "Support Devices". 
For each of these categories, except "No Finding", the assigned weak label is either: (Irvin et al. (2019))

positive (1.0)
negative (0.0)
not mentioned (blank)
uncertain (-1.0)

The development set was annotated by radiologists and therefore only contains the binary labels: (Irvin et al. (2019))

positive (1.0)
negative (0.0)

You can register for obtaining the data under the following link: https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/.
Once the registration is finished, you should receive an email which contains links for two different versions of the dataset, the original CheXpert dataset (around 439 GB) and a version with downsampled resolution (around 11 GB). 
The code below uses the downsampled version. 
Please unzip the downloaded folder in a directory of your choice and don't change the filenames or the folder structure, otherwise you might need to change some of the paths used in the following code in order for it to run properly.
The zip file you obtained should contain a training and a validation set. 
The CheXpert test set is not publicly available, as it is used for the CheXpert competition (see link above). 
The reports that were used to label the images are also unavailable.

## Define storing locations for the preprocessed data

"""
If you wish to save the preprocessed data on your computer, please specify a path to the location where you want to store the data where "storing_location_path" is mentioned in the code underneath.

You will be presented two options of storing the preprocessed data:
    
- storing each preprocessed image tensor with its corresponding labels in a separate .npz file (~ 35 GB in total)
- storing each preprocessed image as a .jpg file and saving all of the labels in a .lib file (~ 2 GB in total)

Please note that in both approaches, the training and the validation set will be stored separately.

## Store the preprocessed data

"""
The two different options of storing the data provided in this tutorial are:
    
- storing each preprocessed image tensor with its corresponding labels in a separate .npz file (~ 35 GB in total)
- storing each resized image as a .jpg file and saving all of the labels in a joblib file (~ 2 GB in total)

The code for each option is commented out, in case you do not wish to store the data
"""

### Store data as .npz files

"""
If you prefer storing the images and labels in .npz files, please run the following code.
"""

# =============================================================================
# # store the training set
# for i, ex in enumerate(chexpert_train):
#       np.savez_compressed(os.path.join(storing_location, "train_images", str(i) + ".npz"), 
#                         image=ex[0], label=ex[1])
#       
# # store the validation set
# for i, ex in enumerate(chexpert_valid):
#       np.savez_compressed(os.path.join(storing_location, "valid_images", str(i) + ".npz"), 
#                         image=ex[0], label=ex[1])
# =============================================================================
   
"""
Please note that the `np.load` function returns an array and not a tensor, so the "image" result has to be transposed and turned into a tensor again.
The labels also need to be converted to a tensor again. 
Here is a quick example how to do this:
"""

# =============================================================================
# to_tensor = transforms.ToTensor()
# 
# example = np.load(os.path.join(storing_location, "train_images", str(0) + ".npz"))
# print(to_tensor(example["image"].transpose(1,2,0)))
# print(torch.FloatTensor(example["label"]))
# 
# # compare with original output from __getitem__()
# print(chexpert_train.__getitem__(0)[0]) # same result
# print(chexpert_train.__getitem__(0)[1]) # same result
# =============================================================================

### Store images as .jpg files

"""
If you want to store the resized images as .jpg files and the labels in .lib files, you can run the code below.
Please note that the normalization that we applied earlier results in negative values in the image tensors, which are not compatible with the `save_image` function that we use to store the images.
The images are therefore saved without the normalization.
Please be aware that storing the images as .jpg files can introduce some slight inaccuracies in the final image tensor (compared to the original output of __getitem__()).
"""

# =============================================================================
# # define transformations (without normalization)
