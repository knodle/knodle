Data Preprocessing

The aim of this project is to find names of people killed by the police in a corpus of news paper articles. The 
corpus was created by Katherine A. Keith et al. (2017) for a similar task using distant supervision. 
This dataset contains mentions of people (based on keywords related to “killing” or “police”) who might 
have been killed by the police. The dataset (the HTML documents scraped in 2016 themselves as well as the 
already sentence-segmented data) are available on the project’s website 
(http://slanglab.cs.umass.edu/PoliceKillingsExtraction/) 
and on MinIO ( https://knodle.dm.univie.ac.at/minio/knodle/datasets/police_killing/). 
There is a train and a test dataset, both of them containing dictionaries with the following keys:

-  docid: unique identifiers of every mention of a person possible killed by the police
-  name: the normalized name of the person
-  downloadtime: time the document was downloaded
-  names_org: the original name of the person mentioned in the document
-  sentnames: other names in the mention (not of the person possibly killed by the police)
-  sent_alter: the mention, name of the person possible killed by the policed replaced by “TARGET”, any other names replaced by “POLICE”
-  plabel: for the training data possibly erroneous labels obtained using weak supervision and gold labels for the test data – in this project, only the labels of the test data will be used
-  sent_org: the original mention

Compared to the Data Preprocessing with RegExt Tutorial 
(https://github.com/knodle/knodle/blob/feature/%23299_police_killing_dataset/examples/data_preprocessing/police_killing/data_preprocessing_with_regex.ipynb), 
where RegEx are used in order to cover various different ways a sentence might indiciate that someone was killed 
by the police, the rules that are used in this tutorial are simple word pairs (one of the killing and one of 
the police related keywords each). A rule matches a sample if both of the words in the wordpair are part of 
the sample. Except the rules that are used, everything is done in the same way as in the alternative tutorial.

Buidling the Z matrix (instances x rules)

 Get the Train Data

For now, the word pairs contained in the *rule2rule_id* dictionary are simple strings. 
To use them as actual rules, we should convert them to regexes firstly to be able to 
look for the exact words in the word pair. For example, the words in the rules must 
not end in another word character (a-z). If the killing word in a rule is, for instance, 
\"kill\", only sentences containing the word \"kill\" should be matched and no sentences 
containing words like \"kills\" or \"killed\" because there are separate rules for these words. 
(This is ensured by appending "\W" - the word not followed by any letter - to both the police 
 and the killing word contained in a rule.) Technically, it is realized by creating a dictionary 
containing the strings of word pairs as keys and a list of the corresponding RegEx as values.

Secondly, we apply the regexes to the samples. In the beginning, everything is stored in a list of dictionaries (one for each individual sample in the train data). The dictionaries contain the sample, a list of the rules matched in it, and a list of the corresponding rule IDs. After that, we convert the list of dictionaries to a Pandas Dataframe.
