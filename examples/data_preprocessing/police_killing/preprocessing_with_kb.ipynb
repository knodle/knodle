    "This tutorial shows how to find names of people killed by the police in a corpus of newspaper articles. The corpus was created by Katherine A. Keith et al. (2017) for a similar task using distant supervision. This dataset contains mentions of people (based on keywords related to “killing” or “police”) who might have been killed by the police. The dataset (the HTML documents scraped in 2016 themselves as well as the already sentence-segmented data) are available on the [project’s website](http://slanglab.cs.umass.edu/PoliceKillingsExtraction/) and on [MinIO]( https://knodle.dm.univie.ac.at/minio/knodle/datasets/police_killing/).

    "### Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a train and a test dataset, both of them containing dictionaries with the following keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tdocid: unique identifiers of every mention of a person possible killed by the police\n",
    "-\tname: the normalized name of the person\n",
    "-\tdownloadtime: time the document was downloaded\n",
    "-\tnames_org: the original name of the person mentioned in the document\n",
    "-\tsentnames: other names in the mention (not of the person possibly killed by the police)\n",
    "-\tsent_alter: the mention, name of the person possible killed by the policed replaced by “TARGET”, any other names replaced by “POLICE”\n",
    "-\tplabel: for the training data possibly erroneous labels obtained using weak supervision and gold labels for the test data – in this project, only the labels of the test data will be used\n",
    "-\tsent_org: the original mention\n",
    "\n",
    "Using weak supervision, a sample should be labelled positive (1) or negative (0) whether it describes the killing of a civilian by the police. Later, we can create a database of civilians' names in positive labelled samples.\n",

    "Compared to the [Data Preprocessing with RegEx Tutorial](https://github.com/knodle/knodle/blob/feature/%23299_police_killing_dataset/examples/data_preprocessing/police_killing/data_preprocessing_with_regex.ipynb), where RegEx are used in order to cover various different ways a sentence might indiciate that someone was killed by the police, in this tutorial the sentences will be labeled using information from a manually created Knowledge Base. Just like Keith et al., we use the [Fatal Encounters Database](https://fatalencounters.org/) (FE-Database). "

If might be possible that the FE-Database contains name versions which do not match with the standardized name of Keith et al., but with one of the versions in the *names_org*-list. (For instance, someone is called *Steiney James Richards Jr.* in the FE-Database and *James Richard* in our samples.)\n",

Then we can create a \"reversed\" dictionary containing all the different name versions as keys and the corresponding standardized name as value. This does not guarantee yet that we can find an exact name of the FE-Database in one of the name versions. Sometimes, a person has two forenames in the FE-Database, but only one forename is kept in the dataset of Keith et al. Therefore, we will also have to expand the list of names in the FE-Database. For persons whose name consists of more than two parts, we will add all different combinations of their name. \n",
