When later keywords are replaced by annotated keywords (e.g. 'ranula' by 'ranula=EVENT-B'), they are only replaced if the keyword does not have a preceding letter or number --> a part of granulation will not be tagged with ranula.

    "Up to now, the BIO-schema was used to tag the data. However, for generating the embeddings for relation extraction (X-matrix in Knodle), another tag-schema is necessary. In this notebook, the apporach from Zhou et al. (2021) is used to generate the embeddings (https://github.com/wzhouad/ATLOP/blob/main/prepro.py). For that, NEs are marked with '\\*' at the beginning and the end. When the keyword-lists are generated above, there were two different tagged keyword lists generated in parallel: one with the BIO-schema and one which I call '\\*'-schema. This allows to replace the BIO-tags with '\\*'-tags.\n",
